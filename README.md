# Blinking Colors Website

This is a simple HTML program that creates a full-screen webpage with a background that blinks through various colors. The colors change every second and include the following: **red**, **indigo**, **green**, **yellow**, **blue**, **orange**, **violet**, **white**, **light green**, **black**, and **sky blue**.

## Features

- Displays a blinking effect with 11 different colors.
- Cycles through colors every second.
- Minimalist design with no content on the page.

## Usage

1. Copy the `index.html` file code provided above and save it as `index.html` in your desired directory.

2. Open the file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

3. Watch the background cycle through the colors.

## How It Works

- The program uses **CSS animations** (`@keyframes`) to define the sequence of background color changes.
- The `animation` property applies the color-changing effect to the `<body>` tag, cycling every 1 second.

## Colors in the Cycle

1. **Red**
2. **Indigo**
3. **Green**
4. **Yellow**
5. **Blue**
6. **Orange**
7. **Violet**
8. **White**

## Customization

To modify the colors or timing:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.
2. Edit the `@keyframes blink` section to add, remove, or reorder colors.
3. Change the `1s` in `animation: blink 1s infinite;` to adjust the speed.
